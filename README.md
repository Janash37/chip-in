# ChipIn

Chip In is an cross-platform mobile app that aims to bring people closer together by connecting volunteers in the community with those that need assistance. Built using React Native, Axios, Cloud Firestore, and written in Javascript, HTML and CSS, this app is the culminating work of our time on the Northcoders bootcamp.

## Technologies used

### Frontend

React Native, React Native Maps

### Backend

Cloud Firestore, Axios

## How to use

As the app is not yet hosted on either the Google Store or Apple Store, the only way to use it is to fork and clone these files down to your own repo. Open the code in the code editor of your choice and run: `npm install`

to make sure all necessary modules are installed. Once complete, run: `npm start`.

This will give you the option to run the app. **Please select 'Android' when prompted**. There is currently no option to run in ios emulation mode and web mode does not work after the inclusion of React Native Maps to the app.

If you download the 'Expo Go' app from the app store of your choice, you will then be able to run the app in development mode on your smartphone. Simply run `expo start` instead of `npm start`.
